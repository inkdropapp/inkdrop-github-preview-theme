# Github Preview Theme

A default Markdown preview theme for [Inkdrop](https://www.inkdrop.app/).

This theme itself does not add any styles since the app provides the default styles based on [GitHub's theme](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css/).

To customize it in your preview theme, tweak the CSS variables that are commented out in `styles/github-markdown.css`.

## How to publish your own theme

Please check out the documentation: [Creating a Theme](https://docs.inkdrop.app/manual/creating-a-theme)
