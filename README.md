# Github Preview Theme

A default Markdown preview theme for [Inkdrop](https://www.inkdrop.app/).

## Theming code blocks

Highlighting code blocks is built with [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/demo/theme.html), and CSS selectors for styling code blocks are compatible with it.
CSS selectors always start with `cm-`.
You can easily import styles from [CodeMirror's theme](https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror/tree/master/theme).

## How to publish your own theme

Please check out the documentation: [Creating a Theme](https://docs.inkdrop.app/manual/creating-a-theme)
